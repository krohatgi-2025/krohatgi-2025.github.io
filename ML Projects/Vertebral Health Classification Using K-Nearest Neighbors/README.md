## Vertebral Health Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors
### Predicting Spinal Abnormalities from Biomechanical X-Ray Features

This project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify vertebral column conditions as **normal** or **abnormal** using six biomechanical measurements derived from lumbar X-ray imaging. Through exploratory data analysis, distance-metric experimentation, learning curves, and weighted KNN, the project demonstrates how feature geometry influences clinical prediction accuracy.

Key highlights:
- Visualization of biomechanical feature distributions  
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation  
- Comparison of Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebyshev, and Mahalanobis metrics  
- Weighted KNN for improved sensitivity to abnormal spinal conditions  
- Clinically interpretable insights into spinal alignment patterns
