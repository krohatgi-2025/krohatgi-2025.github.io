# Vertebral Health Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors

This project builds a machine learning classifier to detect abnormal vertebral conditions (disk herniation, spondylolisthesis) using six biomechanical measurements extracted from lumbar X-rays.
I analyze feature behavior, explore class separability, and evaluate multiple KNN variants (standard, weighted, Minkowski, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Mahalanobis) to understand how distance metrics influence clinical prediction accuracy.
