Hey all! My name is **Karishma Rohatgi**, and I am an aspiring data analyst/engineer with an AI/ML focus.  
This portfolio showcases a selection of engineering, analytics, and machine learning projects I’ve completed throughout my academic and early professional career.

## [GlucoPress — Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Device](./GlucoPress/)

**GlucoPress** is a custom-built biomedical device that estimates blood glucose levels using **photoplethysmography (PPG)** instead of finger-stick measurements.  
My team and I designed and built the full system end-to-end, including:

- A multi-LED optical sensor (red, IR, green)  
- Photodiode receiver + analog front-end amplification  
- Filtering and pulse-shape extraction  
- Feature engineering from PPG waveforms  
- Machine learning regression models for glucose estimation (Random Forest, XGBoost)

The device explores whether optical changes in blood pulse signals can correlate with glucose trends.

## [APS Failure Prediction (Tree-Based ML Models)](./ML%20Projects/APS%20Failure%20Data%20Project/)

This project uses a large, highly imbalanced industrial dataset from Scania Trucks to predict rare **APS (Air Pressure System) failures**.  
The work includes:

- Cleaning and imputing 170 real-valued sensor features  
- Coefficient of Variation and correlation analysis  
- Random Forest (baseline + class-weighted)  
- XGBoost with L1 regularization  
- SMOTE-based oversampling  
- ROC, AUC, and recall-based evaluation  

This project demonstrates advanced tabular modeling and handling of real-world data imbalance.

## [Vertebral Column Classification (Multiclass ML)](./ML%20Projects/Vertebral%20Health%20Classification%20Using%20Machine%20Learning/)

Using curated biomechanical measurements from the vertebral column, this project builds multiclass classifiers to distinguish:

- Herniated disc  
- Spondylolisthesis  
- Normal spine

Methods include:
- Logistic Regression  
- SVM  
- Random Forest  
- Detailed metrics: confusion matrices, precision/recall, ROC curves  

This project highlights my ability to build interpretable medical-data classification models.

## [Multisensor Human Activity Recognition](./ML%20Projects/Multisensor%20Time%20Series%20Human%20Activity%20Recognition/)

This project uses **wearable sensor data** (accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation signals) to classify human activities such as:

- Walking  
- Standing  
- Cycling  
- Sitting  
- Lying  
- Bending  

The pipeline includes:
- Sliding window segmentation  
- Statistical feature extraction (mean, variance, energy)  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models  
- Confusion matrix + ROC/AUC micro/macro evaluation  

This project demonstrates full-stack ML from preprocessing to evaluation on temporal data.
