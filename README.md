Hey all! My name is **Karishma Rohatgi**, and I am an aspiring data analyst/engineer with an AI/ML focus. I have a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and an M.S. in Biomedical Data Analytics from the University of Southern California. 

This portfolio showcases a selection of engineering, analytics, and machine learning projects I’ve completed throughout my academic and early professional career. 

Below is a quick overview of the major projects featured on this site.

## GlucoPress — Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Device
**GlucoPress** is a custom-built biomedical device that estimates blood glucose levels using **photoplethysmography (PPG)** instead of finger-stick measurements.  
I designed and built the full system end-to-end, including:

- A multi-LED optical sensor (red, IR, green)  
- Photodiode receiver + analog front-end amplification  
- Filtering and pulse-shape extraction  
- Feature engineering from PPG waveforms  
- Machine learning regression models for glucose estimation (Random Forest, XGBoost)

The device explores whether optical changes in blood pulse signals can correlate with glucose trends.  
A demo video of the system is available on the project page.

## APS Failure Prediction (Tree-Based ML Models)
This project uses a large, highly imbalanced industrial dataset from Scania Trucks to predict rare **APS (Air Pressure System) failures**.  
The work includes:

- Cleaning and imputing 170 real-valued sensor features  
- Coefficient of Variation and correlation analysis  
- Random Forest (baseline + class-weighted)  
- XGBoost with L1 regularization  
- SMOTE-based oversampling  
- ROC, AUC, and recall-based evaluation  

This project demonstrates advanced tabular modeling and handling of real-world data imbalance.

## Vertebral Column Classification (Multiclass ML)
Using curated biomechanical measurements from the vertebral column, this project builds multiclass classifiers to distinguish:

- Herniated disc  
- Spondylolisthesis  
- Normal spine

Methods include:
- Logistic Regression  
- SVM  
- Random Forest  
- Detailed metrics: confusion matrices, precision/recall, ROC curves  

This project highlights my ability to build interpretable medical-data classification models.

## Multisensor Human Activity Recognition
This project uses **wearable sensor data** (accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation signals) to classify human activities such as:

- Walking  
- Standing  
- Cycling  
- Sitting  
- Lying  
- Bending  

The pipeline includes:
- Sliding window segmentation  
- Statistical feature extraction (mean, variance, energy)  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models  
- Confusion matrix + ROC/AUC micro/macro evaluation  

This project demonstrates full-stack ML from preprocessing to evaluation on temporal data.
